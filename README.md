# Purpose:
```
This application serves as a repurposed weather app I built in IT 202.  
I converted the app from PHP to Python.  
The user is able to input a city name.  
The user is given the temperature, what it feels like, 
the forecast with additional details, the icon for the weather,
humidity, wind speed, and coordinates. 
I do plan to add more functionality to this application.
```
